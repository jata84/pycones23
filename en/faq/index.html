<details>

</details>
<details>

</details>
<details>
<summary>Is the conference only in Spanish?</summary>
<p>The conference will be held <strong>mainly in Spanish</strong>, and depending on the accepted
talks in English, a complete <strong>track</strong> will be made during the days of talks.</p>
<p>The main presentations, opening and closing of the event will be in Spanish,
however, all the people in the organization speak Spanish and English, in case
the people who attend need information in one of the two languages.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which airport is closest to the conference?</summary>
<p>When you book your flight to the island, you will notice that there are two
airports:
<a href="https://www.aena.es/en/tenerife-sur.html">Tenerife South Airport (TFS)</a> and
<a href="https://www.aena.es/en/tenerife-norte-ciudad-de-la-laguna.html/">Tenerife North Airport (TFN)</a>.</p>
<p>The closest is the North airport (TFN) but it is possible to fly to the South
airport (TFS) and then reach the north of the island by Taxis, Buses, or by
renting a car.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>I want to present a talk, how do I do it?</summary>
<p>If you visit the <a href="https://2023.es.pycon.org/c4p/en/">Call for Proposals</a>
section you will find instructions to
create your Abstract and also a link to the platform where proposals are sent,
pretalx.</p>
<p>Inside <a href="https://charlas.2023.es.pycon.org">the link</a> you will find the
instructions (in English and Spanish) and
then you can start filling out the form to send your proposal.</p>
<p>After submitting your proposal, you will have the ability to Edit it, so don't
worry if you have to make changes after submitting it.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>I want to sponsor but how do the add-ons work?</summary>
<p>This year we have added a new modality to Sponsorships, Add-ons.</p>
<p>After selecting a sponsorship plan, you will be able to additionally choose
elements to support the conference independently, such as "Interviews" or
"Breastfeeding Room".</p>
<p>That means that you will be supporting the conference by paying for the plan
you have chosen, plus these independent elements (with limited spaces) for
specific activities.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you need to choose a sponsorship plan before choosing the
Add-ons, from the simplest (Timanfaya) to the most complete (Teide).</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>I am a sponsor. How and how many tickets do I get?</summary>
<p><strong>4 tickets</strong> are reserved for sponsors with a discount associated with the
level of Sponsorship.</p>
<p>Sponsoring companies or institutions will receive a special link to purchase
tickets with their respective discount.</p>
<p>If a company is interested in bringing more people, attention should be paid to
the <strong>general batch</strong> of ticket sales.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>I bought my ticket but I need an invoice, how do I get it?</summary>
<p>If in your case you need an invoice to present it to the entity that is
covering your attendance at the event, we will generate your invoice when the
event takes place or until the deadline to change the details of the conference
tickets. Mainly, due to the complexity of canceling said documents in our
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Remember that the Eventbrite bill can serve as a receipt of your purchase.</p>
<p>for financial purposes of your company.</p>
